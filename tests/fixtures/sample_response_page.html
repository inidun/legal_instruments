    <br />

    <br />
    The Arab States, Parties to the present Convention,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Considering</b> the common heritage and the close community, intellectual and cultural ties which bind them together, and desirous of giving clearer, concrete expression to the intellectual and cultural co-operation enshrined in the Arab Cultural Treaty of 21 Dhoul Hydgah 1364 (27 November 1945) and the Pact of Arab Cultural Unity of 16 Chawal 1383 (29 February 1964), and the relevant bilateral and multilateral agreements,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Desirous</b> of promoting education and scientific research, strengthening their co-operation in those areas and making good use of human resources, with the aim of achieving economic, social and cultural development and maximum integration of the area and of preserving their cultural identity,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Convinced</b> of the necessity of ensuring the recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees in higher education with a view to facilitating the mobility of students, members of the teaching profession, and other specialists and research workers within the region, and being aware of the need to develop education, to promote access thereto and improve its quality and to promote lifelong education,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Convinced</b> that, on account of the diversity and complexity of programmes of study, it is desirable that the recognition of stages of training completed should take into account not only the diplomas and degrees obtained but also the courses of studies followed and the knowledge and experience acquired,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Resolved</b> to organize their co-operation and strengthen it in respect of recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees of higher education by means of a convention which would be the starting point for concerted, dynamic action carried out, in particular, through national, bilateral, subregional and regional bodies set up for that purpose,
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Expressing the hope</b> that this Convention will be a step towards more wideranging action leading to an international convention between all the Member States of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
    <br />

    <br />
    Have agreed as follows
    <br />

    <br />

    <br />
    <b>I. Definitions</b>
    <br />

    <br />
    <b>Article 1</b>
    <br />

    <br />
    1. For the purpose of the present Convention the "recognition" of a certificate, qualification, diploma or degree of higher education obtained in one of the Contracting States means its acceptance by the competent authorities of another Contracting State and the granting to the holder of the rights enjoyed by persons possessing a certificate, qualification, diploma or degree issued by that State with which the certificate, qualification, diploma or degree obtained in the first Contracting State is comparable. Such rights extend to either the pursuit of studies, or the practice of a profession, or both, according to the applicability of the recognition.
    <br />

    <br />
    (a) Recognition by a Contracting State of a certificate, qualification, diploma or degree awarded by another Contracting State with a view to undertaking or pursuing studies at the higher level shall entitle the holder to enter the higher educational and research institutions of any other Contracting State under the same conditions as those applying to holders of a similar certificate, qualification, diploma or degree issued in the Contracting State concerned. Such recognition does not exempt the holder of the certificate, qualification, diploma or degree from complying with the other conditions laid down by the law or with the regulations governing admission to higher educational institutions.
    <br />

    <br />
    (b) A Contracting State which recognizes a certificate, qualification, diploma or degree enabling the holder to practice a profession thereby recognizes the holder's technical ability and confers on him rights and obligations identical to those which he would have if he obtained such a certificate, qualification, diploma or degree directly in that State with a view to the practice of the same profession. Such recognition does not exempt the holder of the certificate, qualification, diploma or degree from complying with the other conditions laid down by the law in force in each State or conditions-for the practice of the profession concerned which may be laid down by the competent governmental or professional authorities.
    <br />

    <br />
    2. For the purposes of the present Convention:
    <br />

    <br />
    (a) "secondary education" means that stage of studies of any kind which follows primary, elementary, preparatory or intermediate education and the aims of which may include preparing pupils for higher education;
    <br />

    <br />
    (b) "higher education" means all types of education and research at post-secondary level. Such education is open to all persons who have obtained a diploma or certificate attesting that they have successfully completed their education at the secondary level or at an equivalent level in accordance with the conditions laid down for that purpose by the State concerned.
    <br />

    <br />
    3. For the purpose of the present Convention, "partial studies" means any education of which the duration or the content is partial by comparison with the norms prevailing in the institution in which it was acquired. Recognition by a Contracting State of partial studies pursued in an institution situated in the territory of another Contracting State and recognized by that State may be granted in accordance with the educational level reached by the student in the, opinion of the State granting recognition.
    <br />

    <br />

    <br />

    <br />

    (ii) to improve the system for the exchange of information regarding the recognition of studies, diplomas and degrees;

    <br />

    <br />
    (v) to adopt flexible criteria for the evaluation of partial studies, based on the educational level reached and on the content of the courses taken, bearing in mind the interdisciplinary character of knowledge at, university level;

    (vi) to make their higher educational institutions as widely accessible as possible to students from any of the Contracting States;

    <br />

    <br />
    (c) promoting the widest and most effective use of human resources so as to contribute to the acceleration of the development of the countries con cerned whilst at the same time avoiding the "brain drain" from the Arab States;

    <br />

    <br />
    2. Admission to a given higher educational institution may, however, be dependent on the availability of places, and on compatibility with the host country's planning and development needs.
